    <!--    Puzzles-->
    <string name="puzzle1">To start, here is one of the oldest and most well-known lateral thinking problems.\nA man lives on the tenth floor of a building. Every day he takes the elevator to go down to the ground floor to go to work or to go shopping. When he returns he takes the elevator to the seventh floor and walks up the stairs to reach his apartment on the tenth floor. why does he do it?</string>

The rope around his neck is ten feet long and his feet are three feet off the ground. The nearest wall is 20 feet away from the man. It is not possible to climb up the walls or along the rafters. The man hanged himself. How did he do it?</string>
    <string name="puzzle3">You are escaping from a labyrinth, and there are three doors in front of you. The door on the left leads to hell. The door in the center takes you to a deadly assassin. The door on the right leads to a lion that has not eaten in three months. Which door do you choose?</string>
    <string name="puzzle4">A man is lying dead in the field. Next to him is an unopened package. There is no other creature in the field. How did he die?</string>
    <string name="puzzle5">Anthony and Cleopatra were together in a house for the weekend. All the doors and windows were locked and no one else was in the house. On Monday the maid came in with a key and on opening the door of the main room she saw that there was broken glass on the floor although the windows were intact. Anthony was asleep in the chair. The maid knew instantly that Cleopatra had been killed although her body was nowhere to be found and no blood </string>
    <string name="puzzle6">You have two 1 liter mugs â€“ one of them halfway filled with water and the other one halfway filled with wine. You pour 300ml water from the first mug into the second one, stir it well, then pour 300ml of the mix from the second mug back to the first one. Now, do you have more water in the first mug than you have wine in the second one?</string>
    <string name="puzzle7">A man lived alone in a house for two months. Nobody came to visit him and he never went out. At the end of that time, he became deranged. One night he put out the fire, turned off the lights, and walked out of the house. He was never seen or heard of again. His actions in leaving that house resulted in the deaths of 90 people. Why was that?</string>
    <string name="puzzle8">Because of its brevity, simplicity, and difficulty, this puzzle has some merits for being considered the best lateral thinking puzzle of all time.\nA man walks into a bar and asks the barman for a glass of water. The barman pulls out a gun and points it at the man. The man says "Thank you" and walks out.</string>

    <string name="about_app">Surely you are used to problems in which you use logic step by step or employ some knowledges to solve them. I am sorry to tell you that none of that will do you this time. Lateral Thinking puzzles require above all creativity and a different point of view than usual. This questionnaire will test how developed that playful part of your brain is, which sometimes is so difficult for us to wake up in the day to day problems.\nWhen you finish, you can search internet for solutions. The puzzles are generally quite popular, so I do not think you have problems. However, I would recommend that you do not search for the answer until your head has exploded first thinking. Realizing the solution by yourself is a pleasure that you should not loose.</string>
